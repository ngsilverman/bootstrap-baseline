<h1>{LESS} Baseline</h1>
<blockquote><p>The baseline is the line upon which letters "sit".</p></blockquote>

<p>You can see on this page every line of text and every title conforms to
a vertical grid. Everything sits neatly on a line. Now, the print
industry&mdash;books, newspapers, magazines&mdash;have been doing this
forever because it's best for the readers. It's easier to read, it simply
feels right.</p>

<p>And yet, nearly every website you've ever visited breaks this rule. Not
that they mean to. It's just that CSS makes it a hassle to conform to the same
baseline accross an entire page. Enter <strong>Baseline</strong>.</p>
